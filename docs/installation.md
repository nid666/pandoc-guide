# Installation

---

Similarly to downloading Pandoc, installing it is different depending on the operating system you are using. 

**Warning: Trying to use another operating systems install instructions will result in the installation failing.**

## Windows: 
1. Locate the downloaded file
	*the file will have a .msi extension*

2. Run the installer

3. Click "Run" in the security window as shown:

5. Finally, select install

When the installer closes automatically, you will know Pandoc has successfully installed!

## Mac:
