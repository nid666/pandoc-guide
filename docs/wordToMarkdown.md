	</figure>

## Conversion Instructions

1. Move the Word file you want to convert onto your desktop

2. In the terminal or command prompt type

	> cd Desktop

3. Then copy and paste the following command into the window:
	> pandoc -s input.docx -t
	markdown --extract-media=images -o
	output.md

4. Modify the "input.docx" to match the name of your Word file on your desktop

5. Optionally, you may change the name of output.md to change the name of the output file before it is made

6. Once you press enter, the outputted .md file will be generated and saved to your desktop

**Warning: Pandoc is not perfect. It will create potential formatting issues in your conversion from word to markdown. The only way to fix these is to edit your markdown file manually after it has been created. Remove any incorrectly placed markdown tags until the document is formatted to your liking**
